Alfred Timekeeper

This is the main program used in the workflow for [Alfred Timekeeper](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/AlfredTimeKeeper.alfredworkflow?raw=true). You can find more information about my different Alfred project on [my web site](http://customct.com/alfred-2-workflows).

This program is written in [go](http://golang.org/). The full workflow can be downloaded as [AlfredTimekeeper.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/AlfredTimeKeeper.alfredworkflow?raw=true).
